# Problem Statement

A smart solution to curb the emission of greenhouse gases in IT industries

# Brief About The Idea

Software And IT companies have acquired large real state for their office and data centre needs.

But the per sqft consumption rate of these areas is very low. And a lot of free space is available which can be utilised productively. And by definition free space is all the space that is not directly contributing to employees productivity or companies revenue.

This solution presents an idea to leverage these free space for **_Vertical Farming_**

We wish to convert the free spaces inside office buildings to vertical farms.


Vertical Farming is an indoor farming technique in which we cultivate crops in _controlled environments_.
It optimises the use of land, water and manpower by leveraging technology.
States of art **IoT** systems are deployed in these farms to collect and analyse data and lots of 
manual interventions are automated with the help of robotics and automation.


The Air-Conditioned Offices of Tech Companies suits these need.
They can be controlled to suit the temprature, humidity needs of crops.


And the employee can volunteer some of their free time as a farmer.
As we will automate most of the operation very minimal human effort is needed.


The more plants we grow the better we consume greenhouse gases
